These are a handful of dimensions to look at when chosing a bank partner to launch a new product:

* Location
* Experience
* Regulatory Concerns
* Work Cadence
* Contract Terms 
  * Length
  * Pricing
  * Minimums
  * Rev Share


## Location
Depending upon the product offering, the physical location of a bank partner can highly influence their ability to support your product. For example, when issuing credit products, some banks are beholden to their state regulations that may treat fees in an non-obvious way.

For credit, the typical states to issue out of are: Utah, Deleware and South Dakota. There are a few others that work relatively well, and some that one must avoid, such as New York.

## Experience
In choosing a bank, one of the biggest concerns is in making sure that bank has experience issuing the product your are planning on launching. If they have not previosuly brought that product to market, you will likely have to spend more effort than would otherwise be necessary getting them prepped to launch and ensuring they understand all the nuances about your product type.

## Regulatory Concerns
It is an open secret that fintech companies have run into issues when their partner banks get dinged for regulatory issues, for their program or any other program the bank is running.  When this happens, it can stall growth and ability to make any meaningful product changes.  Therefore, when looking at a partner bank, one should also evaluate their regulatory risk based upon how they underwrite programs

## Work Cadence
One of the most important concepts when choosing a bank partner, if you have a choice, is the speed at whcih you're able to iterate with them.  Since the bank is technically the issuer of the product and you will just be the marketer and maybe program manager, 

## Contracting
When partnering with a bank, there are a few models for how it will look.  It can be a revenue share, pay per click pricing, or some mashup of those two.
